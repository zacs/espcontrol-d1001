# Card Types

Cards are the controls and information tiles shown on the EspControl screen. Each card type is built for a specific job: some send Home Assistant actions, some display live state, some control local panel hardware, and some open extra pages.

Use this page when you know what you want the panel to do but are not sure which card type to choose.

## Entity-Based and Local Cards

Most cards use Home Assistant entities. The entity ID is the exact name Home Assistant uses, such as `light.kitchen`, `sensor.outdoor_temperature`, or `media_player.living_room`.

Some cards do not need a Home Assistant entity:

- **Trigger** sends a custom event that Home Assistant automations can listen for.
- **Local Sensor** shows a value supplied by the panel firmware.
- **Webhook** sends a direct HTTP request.
- **Action > Local Action** runs a registered callback on the panel itself.
- **Date & Time**, **World Clock**, **Screen Lock**, and **Subpage** can work from the panel itself.
- **Internal Switches** controls built-in relay hardware on supported panels.

## Grouped Card Types

Some names in the setup page group several related modes:

| Setup page name | Modes |
|---|---|
| **Lights** | All Controls, Switch, Brightness, Colour Temperature |
| **Fans** | Switch, Speed, Oscillation, Direction, Preset |
| **Action** | Scene, Script, Automation, Button, Helper, Option Select, Local Action |
| **Vacuum** | Status, Start / Stop, Dock, Pause / Resume, Spot Clean, Locate, Clean Area |
| **Lawn Mower** | Status, Start Mowing, Dock, Pause / Resume |
| **Alarm** | Combined Control, Arm Away, Arm Home, Arm Night, Arm Vacation, Disarm |
| **Date & Time** | Clock, Date, Time & Date, World Clock |
| **Media** | Play/Pause, Previous, Next, Volume, Track Position, Now Playing |
| **Cover** | All Controls, Position, Tilt, Toggle, Open, Close, Stop, Set Position |
| **Subpage** | Generic, Switch, Lights, Climate, Presence, Media, Alarm, Cover, Garage Door, Gate, Lock, Vacuum, Lawn Mower, Weather, Sensor, Camera / Image |

## Permissions

Cards that control Home Assistant need the panel to be allowed to perform Home Assistant actions. If a control card displays correctly but tapping it does nothing, check [Enable Actions](/getting-started/home-assistant-actions).

Read-only display cards such as Sensor, Presence, Date & Time, and current Weather state can still show information without sending control actions. Weather forecast modes also need Home Assistant actions permission because the panel asks Home Assistant for forecast data.
