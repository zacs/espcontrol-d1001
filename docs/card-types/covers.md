  How to use cover cards on your EspControl panel to control blinds, shutters, and other cover entities from Home Assistant.

# Cover

A cover card lets you control a Home Assistant cover entity — blinds, shutters, roller shades, gates, or garage doors — from one all-controls card, as a direct slider, as a toggle, or as a one-tap command.

## Setting Up a Cover

1. Select a card and change its type to **Cover**.
2. Choose the interaction:
   - **All Controls** opens a full-screen control with tabs for simple controls, position, tilt, and position presets.
   - **Slider: Position** lets you drag to a precise cover position.
   - **Slider: Tilt** lets you drag to a precise cover tilt position.
   - **Toggle** opens or closes the cover with a tap.
   - **Open**, **Close**, and **Stop** send that cover command, or the tilt version when the entity only supports tilt.
   - **Set Position** sends the cover to the fixed percentage you enter, or the tilt position when the entity only supports tilt.
3. Your Home Assistant cover entity needs to support tilt for **Slider: Tilt** mode to work.
4. Enter an **Entity** — the Home Assistant cover entity you want to control (for example, `cover.office_blind`).
5. Set a **Label** (optional) — shown at the bottom of the card. If left blank, the entity's friendly name from Home Assistant is used.
6. Choose icons:
   - Slider and Toggle modes use **Closed Icon** and **Open Icon**.
   - Open, Close, Stop, and Set Position use one **Icon**.

## How It Works on the Panel

### All Controls Interaction

- **Tap** the card to open the full-screen cover controls.
- The card fill shows the current cover position, using the same closed-amount fill as the position slider.
- The **Simple Controls** tab shows the supported actions: **Up**, **Stop**, and **Down**. For tilt-only covers, these use Home Assistant's tilt commands.
- The **Position** tab lets you drag the cover position from 0 to 100 percent, and is hidden when the entity does not support position control.
- The **Tilt** tab appears only when the Home Assistant cover entity supports tilt, and lets you drag the cover tilt from 0 to 100 percent.
- The **Presets** tab appears when position control is supported and provides one-tap positions at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent.
- Position and tilt update when Home Assistant reports `current_position` and `current_tilt_position`.

### Slider Interaction

- **Drag** the slider to set the selected cover value from 0 to 100.
- In **Position** mode, releasing the slider sends the new position to Home Assistant via `cover.set_cover_position`.
- In **Tilt** mode, releasing the slider sends the new tilt value to Home Assistant via `cover.set_cover_tilt_position`.
- The **fill bar** is always vertical and represents how much the cover is closed — a fully closed cover shows a full bar, and a fully open cover shows an empty bar. This inverted fill matches blinds or shutters blocking a window.
- The fill bar updates in real time as the cover moves, tracking `current_position` in **Position** mode and `current_tilt_position` in **Tilt** mode.

### Toggle Interaction

- **Tap** the card to toggle the cover through Home Assistant.
- The card lights up while the cover is closed or closing.
- When the cover state changes, the label temporarily shows the Home Assistant state, such as **Open**, **Closed**, **Opening**, or **Closing**.
- After the state settles, the card changes back to showing the configured label.

### Command Interactions

- **Open** sends `cover.open_cover`, or `cover.open_cover_tilt` for tilt-only covers.
- **Close** sends `cover.close_cover`, or `cover.close_cover_tilt` for tilt-only covers.
- **Stop** sends `cover.stop_cover`, or `cover.stop_cover_tilt` for tilt-only covers.
- **Set Position** sends `cover.set_cover_position`, or `cover.set_cover_tilt_position` for tilt-only covers, with the configured value from 0 to 100.
- Command cards briefly flash when tapped. They do not stay highlighted based on the live cover state.

## Cover Icons

Slider and Toggle cover cards use two icons: one for the closed state and one for the open or partially open state. Command cover cards use one icon.
