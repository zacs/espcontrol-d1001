# Setting Up Your Device's Screen

Your EspControl panel has a built-in web page where you can set everything up. Open it by typing the panel's address into any browser on your phone or computer.

::: tip Finding the address
The address is shown on the display screen when no cards are configured yet. You can also find it in your router's connected devices list, or in Home Assistant under **Settings > Devices & Services > ESPHome**.

### Adding a Card

Tap any empty space in the grid (shown as a dashed outline with a **+** icon). A settings panel appears below the preview where you configure the card:

![Light card settings panel showing card type, entity, label, and icon fields](/images/settings-panel-light-card.png)

The setup page uses these card names and grouped modes on the device. For a quick comparison, see the [Card Types overview](/card-types/).

| Type | What it does | Needs an entity? |
|---|---|---|
| **[Switch](/card-types/switches)** | Controls a Home Assistant entity and shows its on/off state. This is the default card type. | Yes |
| **[Lights](/card-types/lights)** | Controls a light as a full control popup, switch, brightness slider, or colour temperature slider. | Yes, as a light entity |
| **[Action](/card-types/actions)** | Runs a one-tap Home Assistant scene, script, button, helper action, Option Select picker, or local panel action. | Depends on the selected action |

For cards that use Home Assistant, enter the entity name from Home Assistant in the **Entity** field, such as `light.living_room`, `switch.garden_lights`, `scene.movie_mode`, or `weather.forecast_home`. Some card types use a more specific label, such as **Sensor Entity**, **Weather Entity**, or **Climate Entity**. You can find entity names under **Settings > Devices & Services** in Home Assistant.

Some card names group several related controls together. **Lights** contains All Controls, Switch, Brightness, and Colour Temperature options. **Fans** contains Switch, Speed, Oscillation, Direction, and Preset options. **Action** contains scene, script, helper, Option Select, and Local Action modes. **Sensor** contains Home Assistant and Local Sensor sources. **Vacuum** contains Status, Start / Stop, Dock, Pause / Resume, Spot Clean, Locate, and Clean Area options. **Lawn Mower** contains Status, Start Mowing, Dock, and Pause / Resume options. **Cover** contains All Controls, Position, Tilt, Toggle, Open, Close, Stop, and Set Position options. **Alarm** contains Combined Control, Arm Away, Arm Home, Arm Night, Arm Vacation, and Disarm options. **Date & Time** contains Clock, Date, Time & Date, and World Clock options.

For the generated list of current card domains, subpage support, grouping, and options, see the [Card Capability Reference](/generated/cards/capabilities).

Most cards also let you choose an icon and set a label. If the label is left blank, the panel uses the friendly name from Home Assistant when it can.

### Active Switch Display

Each [Switch](/card-types/switches) card has separate **Off Icon** and **On Icon** settings. The on icon is used while the entity is active.

You can also turn on **Active Display**:

- **Numeric** — show a live reading instead of the icon, for example temperature, power usage, or a percentage. Pick the **Sensor Entity**, **Unit**, and **Unit Precision**.
- **Text** — show a live text state instead of the label, for example a machine status or current mode.

When the entity is not active, the card goes back to its off icon and normal label.

### Moving Cards

Drag and drop any card to reposition it. If you drop it onto an occupied space, the existing card shifts to the next available slot.

### Card Sizes

Right-click a card and open **Size** to choose:

- **Single** - normal one-slot card.
- **Tall** - spans two rows.
- **Wide** - spans two columns.
- **Large** - spans a 2 x 2 area.

If a card already occupies the space needed for a larger size, the setup page tries to move it to the next available slot. If there is not enough room, the size change is not applied.

## Device Settings

The **Settings** tab also includes display, brightness, screensaver, backup, and firmware update controls.

![Settings tab showing appearance, backlight, schedule, clock, and firmware controls](/images/settings-tab-display.png)

Open **Settings > System > Home Assistant Settings** to change **Home Assistant Port** if your Home Assistant instance does not use the default `8123` port. Camera/image cards and media artwork downloads use this port when loading images from Home Assistant.

## Apply Configuration

After making changes, tap **Apply Configuration** at the bottom of the page. The panel restarts and loads your new settings — you'll see a message while it reconnects.

## Restart From Home Assistant

Each EspControl device has an enabled **Restart** button in Home Assistant. Open **Settings > Devices & services > ESPHome**, choose your EspControl device, and look under its configuration controls. Pressing **Restart** safely restarts the display without changing its cards, brightness, schedules, or other saved settings.

You can also press the button from a Home Assistant automation. Replace `button.your_panel_restart` with the Restart entity shown for your display:

```yaml
actions:
  - action: button.press
    target:
      entity_id: button.your_panel_restart
```

If the automation runs when Home Assistant starts, wait until the Restart entity is available before pressing it:

```yaml
actions:
  - wait_template: >
      {{ states.button.your_panel_restart is not none
         and not is_state('button.your_panel_restart', 'unavailable') }}
  - action: button.press
    target:
      entity_id: button.your_panel_restart
```

The web setup page's **Apply Configuration** button remains separate: use it after saving web settings, and use the Home Assistant **Restart** entity when you only need to restart the display.
