# Media Cover Art

Media Cover Art can turn the panel into a now-playing display while a selected Home Assistant media player is playing.

You will find these controls in **Settings > Sleep & Schedule > Media Cover Art** on the panel web page.

## Settings

- **Show Cover Art** - enables the cover art display and keeps the screen awake while artwork is shown.
- **Media Player Entity** - chooses the media player entity to watch, such as `media_player.living_room`.
- **Show After** - chooses whether cover art appears immediately or waits for the selected delay.
- **Show After** also controls how long cover art waits before returning after you dismiss it by touch.
- **Show Track Details For** - controls how long track information is shown over the artwork on the 4-inch square displays.
- **Advanced Options** - contains source and filtering controls you may not need every day.
- **Hide for external source inputs** - hides cover art when the selected media player source is `TV` or `Line-in`.
- **Advanced Filtering** - reveals **Only Show When**, which limits cover art to matching media player attributes, such as `app_id=com.apple.TVMusic` or `app_id=com.apple.TVMusic; media_content_type=music`.

If cover art is shown for `TV` or `Line-in` instead of hidden, the artist line shows **Source** because these inputs normally do not provide artist data.

Cover art is separate from the normal [Screensaver](/features/screensaver) mode. Use Screensaver when you want the panel to dim, show a clock, or turn off after inactivity.

If your Home Assistant instance uses a custom port, open **Settings > System > Home Assistant Settings** and set **Home Assistant Port** to match it. Media cover art downloads use this port when loading artwork from Home Assistant.
