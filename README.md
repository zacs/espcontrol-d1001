# EspControl

**Turn an affordable touchscreen into a simple smart home control panel.**

EspControl lets you put the Home Assistant controls you use every day onto a dedicated screen: lights by the door, heating in the hallway, garage controls in the utility room, room temperatures on a desk, or a tidy bedside panel for scenes and alarms.

You do not need to write code, edit YAML, or build your own ESPHome setup. Install the firmware from a web browser, connect the screen to WiFi, add it to Home Assistant, then choose what appears on the display from the screen's built-in setup page.

**Documentation and install guide:** [jtenniswood.github.io/espcontrol](https://jtenniswood.github.io/espcontrol/)

## What It Unlocks

- **A real control panel for your home** - give family and guests simple buttons instead of asking them to use the Home Assistant app.
- **Room-by-room control** - place a small screen where it is useful: kitchen, hallway, office, garage, bedroom, or next to a door.
- **One-tap routines** - run scenes, scripts, and automations such as movie mode, bedtime, away mode, or garden lights.
- **Live home information** - show temperatures, sensors, weather, dates, clocks, and other Home Assistant readings at a glance.
- **Flexible pages of controls** - keep the main screen simple, then open extra pages for rooms, devices, or less common actions.
- **Local smart home control** - the panel talks to Home Assistant on your own network. It is not a cloud dashboard.
- **Easy changes later** - rearrange buttons, change icons, adjust colours, back up your setup, and install firmware updates without starting again.

## What You Can Control

EspControl works with devices and helpers that are already in Home Assistant, including:

- Lights, switches, fans, and plugs
- Scenes, scripts, buttons, and automations
- Blinds, shutters, covers, and garage doors
- Media players for playback, volume, progress, and now-playing display
- Climate controls for thermostats and HVAC devices
- Sensors such as temperature, humidity, power, battery, or custom text states
- Weather, clocks, dates, and time zones
- Built-in relays on supported panels

If Home Assistant can see it, EspControl is designed to make it easier to put that control or information on a touchscreen.

## How It Works

1. **Buy a supported ESP32 touchscreen.**
2. **Install EspControl from your browser** using the web installer.
3. **Connect the screen to WiFi** using the setup screen it creates.
4. **Add it to Home Assistant** when Home Assistant discovers it.
5. **Allow Home Assistant actions** so the panel is permitted to control your devices.
6. **Open the panel's web page** and choose the buttons, sensors, pages, colours, and display settings you want.

After that, the panel runs on its own. You can still change the layout at any time from a phone, tablet, or computer browser.

## Supported Screens

EspControl supports several low-cost ESP32 touchscreens. Larger screens give you more room for controls; smaller screens are useful beside doors, on desks, or in individual rooms.

## Contributor Checks

After changing card configuration, the web setup page, or generated device files, run:

- `npm run check:product`
- `npm run check:fast`
- `npm run check:web-browser-smoke`
- `npm run docs:build`

Use `npm run check:product` as the focused product preflight when changing shared schema,
card behavior, web setup behavior, device metadata, generated outputs, backup compatibility,
or release-facing metadata.
